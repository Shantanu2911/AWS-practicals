## Cloud Computing

- Cloud computing is the delievery of computing services - including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence - over the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

### Benefits of Cloud

- Faster time to market
- Scalability and flexibility
- Cost Savings
- Better Collaboration
- Advanced Security
- Data loss prevention

### Disadvantages of Cloud

- risk of vendor lock-in
- less control over underlying cloud infrastructure
- concerns about security risks like data privacy and onine threats
- integration complexity with existing systems
- unforeseen costs and unexpected expenses

### Hyperscalars
- A hyperscaler is a type of large-scale data center that offers massive computing resources, typically in the form of an elastic cloud platform. Organizations use them to deploy and manage large-scale applications and services.

## Cloud Service Model

- IaaS (Infrastructure as a service)
- PaaS (Platform as a service)
- SaaS (Software as a service)

## Compute Services

- Elastic Compute Cloud - EC2
- ECS/EKS - Containerized Services
- Lambda - Serverless (Serverless is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers. There are still servers in serverless, but they are abstracted away from app development)

## Storage Services

- Simple Storage Services - S3
- Elastic Block Store - EBS
- Elastic File System - EFS
- Archival Service - Glacier

## Network Services

- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Domain Name Service - Route 53
